# 🤖 Effective AI Agent Design Patterns with LangGraph & CrewAI

This repository presents a structured implementation of **AI agent design patterns** using two powerful frameworks: **LangGraph** and **CrewAI**. Inspired by the *"Building Effective Agents"* methodology, the notebooks showcase reusable agent workflows, decision strategies, and modular patterns that scale across domains.

---

## 📌 Objective

- Understand and apply agent design patterns using LangGraph and CrewAI.
- Implement agent workflows with memory, tools, and conditional transitions.
- Visualize and debug execution using **LangSmith Studio** and **CrewAI built-in traces**.
- Demonstrate side-by-side implementations using both frameworks.

## 📘 LangGraph-Based Notebooks

| Notebook | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `basic_agent.ipynb` | A minimal LangGraph agent that takes an input and returns a response using a reactive pattern. |
| `stateful_agent.ipynb` | Demonstrates memory-based transitions and agent state progression using a state machine approach. |
| `multi_tool_agent.ipynb` | Combines multiple tools with conditional logic to execute complex tasks using tool routing. |

🛠️ Includes LangSmith trace demonstration for better observability and debugging.

## 🧠 CrewAI-Based Notebooks

| Notebook | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `basic_agent.ipynb` | Simple CrewAI agent configured with roles, tasks, and tools for structured reasoning. |
| `task_pipeline.ipynb` | Implements a pipeline where agents collaborate in a predefined task sequence. |
| `grok_simulation.ipynb` | A simulation of generative reasoning using CrewAI and Grok-style output chaining. |

🔍 Includes built-in agent logging and task summaries for visibility into decision flow.
